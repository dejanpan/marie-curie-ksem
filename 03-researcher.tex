\textbf{Potential for reaching a position of professional maturity}
Mr. Pangercic is a skillful researcher, who has already had the chance to integrate in a highly 
competitive scientific environment other than the university at which he is conducting his
studies.  His participation in a European program like \ksem will enable him to expand 
his scientific knowledge and skills. Expanding his work in such a high-standard research 
and educational institutions, will enable her to further increase her 
research experience and will develop her collaboration skills, integrate and  provide his 
ways to establish himself in the wide European scientific community. The gain of research 
experience in a competitive environment will be the step forward that will soon help him
attain a position of professional maturity in a university or a research institution. The 
measures foreseen to help the applicant reach professional maturity are connected to the 
possibility of pursuing a novel challenging research project in a well established research 
institution and a group which has successfully trained junior scientists in the past. 
Specifically, within two more years of postdoctoral experience, new knowledge will be 
acquired together with new scientific and communicative/collaborative skills, additional 
teaching experience will be gained, as well as tutoring of graduate and undergraduate 
students in the partner group. \\
