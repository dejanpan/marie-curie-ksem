    abstract = {Many real-world domains are relational in nature, consisting of a set of objects related to each other in complex ways. This paper focuses on predicting the existence and the type of links between entities in such domains. We apply the relational Markov network framework of Taskar et al. to define a joint probabilistic model over the entire link graph--- entity attributes and links. The application of the RMN algorithm to this task requires the definition of probabilistic patterns over subgraph structures. We apply this method to two new relational datasets, one involving university webpages, and the other a social network. We show that the collective classification approach of RMNs, and the introduction of subgraph patterns over link labels, provide significant improvements in accuracy over flat classification, which attempts to predict each link in isolation.},

@book{DeRaedt08Learning,
  abstract = {This textbook covers logical and relational learning in depth,
    and hence provides an introduction to inductive logic programming (ILP),
    multirelational data mining (MRDM) and (statistical) relational learning
    (SRL).  These subfields of data mining and machine learning are concerned
    with the analysis of complex and structured data sets that arise in
    numerous applications, such as bio- and chemoinformatics, network
    analysis, Web mining, natural language processing, within the rich
    representations offered by relational databases and computational logic.
    The author introduces the machine learning and representational
    foundations of the field and explains some important techniques in detail
    by using some of the classic case studies centered around well-known
    logical and relational systems.  The book is suitable for use in graduate
    courses and should be of interest to graduate students and researchers in
    computer science, databases and artificial intelligence, as well as
    practitioners of data mining and machine learning.  It contains numerous
    figures and exercises, and slides are available for many chapters.},
